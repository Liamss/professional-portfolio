      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p> 
        <br><br>
        I was inspired to study Marketing Management in Manchester, after one summer in high-school
        spent watching American shopping channels. Their distinctly enthuastic approach to selling
        products had me hooked.
        <br><br>
        After graduating, I developed deep channel experience at a large global agency, learning the
        fundamentals over a range of verticals. By the end of my time in this role I was managing a team
        across numerous verticals. 
        <br><br>
        Eurostar, one of the agency clients, invited me to join their team. Here, I developed beyond
        performance, into brand building, offline buying, econometrics, full service agency pitches,
        organisational strategy and partnering with Product & Revenue teams.
        <br><br>
        Following pandemic-related redundancy, I quickly started freelancing, working with agencies and for the first time, start-ups. One of those start-ups turned into a two year project to help establish their media function and kick-start audience & revenue targets.
